    annotation:
      'Martinez and Thompson (2023) examined the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes among teenagers over a three-year period. The researchers tracked 2,500 adolescents aged 13 to 18, measuring daily screen time alongside standardized mental health assessments including the Beck Depression Inventory and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Their findings revealed a significant correlation between excessive social media use exceeding four hours daily and increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. The study employed both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to provide a comprehensive analysis of how different platforms affect psychological well-being differently.',
