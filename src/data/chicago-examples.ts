      'Martinez and Thompson examine the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes in teenagers over a three-year period. The study tracked 2,500 adolescents aged 13-18, measuring daily screen time alongside standardized mental health assessments. Their findings reveal a significant correlation between excessive social media use exceeding four hours daily and increased anxiety and depression symptoms. The researchers employ both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to provide a comprehensive analysis.',

Drawing on decolonial theory and extensive analysis of climate conference proceedings, the author argues that current governance structures reproduce inequitable power dynamics. The article\'s theoretical framework is sophisticated and the textual analysis rigorous. However, Okonkwo occasionally overstates the intentionality behind inequitable outcomes, underemphasizing institutional inertia.',
