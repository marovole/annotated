    annotation:
      'Martinez and Thompson examine the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes in teenagers over a three-year period. The study tracked 2,500 adolescents aged 13-18, measuring daily screen time alongside standardized mental health assessments. Their findings reveal a significant correlation between excessive social media use exceeding four hours daily and increased anxiety and depression symptoms. The researchers employ both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to provide a comprehensive analysis.',
